CTO at [SchemeFlow (YC S24)](https://www.schemeflow.com). We are building the next-generation platform for civil engineers to write reports for construction projects - think Cursor for Transport Planners, Flood Risk Engineers, and Environmental Consultants (and more!)

Previously a Principal ML Engineer at [Datatonic](www.datatonic.com), a leading Data & AI consultancy and 10x Google  Partner of the Year. My focus was on Production ML systems (MLOps), combining Data Science & ML Engineering with modern DevOps approaches to help our customers move from just experimenting and prototyping with AI, to working with end-to-end production-ready systems, addressing many of the challenges that companies face in getting business value from AI.
