CTO at <a href="https://www.schemeflow.com" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">SchemeFlow (YC S24)</a>
. We are building the next-generation platform for civil engineers to write reports for construction projects - think Cursor for Transport Planners, Flood Risk Engineers, and Environmental Consultants (and more!)

Previously a Principal ML Engineer at <a href="https://www.datatonic.com" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">Datatonic</a>, a leading Data & AI consultancy and 10x Google  Partner of the Year. My focus was on Production ML systems (MLOps), combining Data Science & ML Engineering with modern DevOps approaches to help our customers move from just experimenting and prototyping with AI, to working with end-to-end production-ready systems, addressing many of the challenges that companies face in getting business value from AI.
