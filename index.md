Consultant DevOps Engineer at [Datatonic](https://www.datatonic.com), a leading Data & AI consultancy and Google's Global AI + ML Partner of the Year (2019). My focus is on the rapidly evolving area of MLOps (Machine Learning Ops), combining Data Science & ML Engineering with modern DevOps approaches to help our customers move from just experimenting and prototyping with AI, to working with end-to-end production-ready systems, addressing many of the challenges that companies face in getting business value from AI.

The main technologies I work with day-to-day are Google Cloud Platform (GCP), Kubernetes, Terraform, Python and GitLab/GitHub Actions for CI/CD.

Outside of IT, I have developed a passion for technical theatre and live events. Please take a look at some of my past [projects](/projects).
