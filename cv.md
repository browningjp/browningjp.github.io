## Work Experience

#### **December 2020 - Present:** DevOps Engineer - *Datatonic*

Consultant DevOps Engineer for Datatonic, a leading Data & AI consultancy and Google's Global AI + ML Partner of the Year (2019).

My focus is on the rapidly evolving area of MLOps (Machine Learning Ops), combining Data Science & ML Engineering with modern DevOps approaches to help our customers move from just experimenting and prototyping with AI, to working with end-to-end production-ready systems, addressing many of the challenges that companies face in getting business value from AI.

The main technologies I work with day-to-day are Google Cloud Platform (GCP), Kubernetes, Terraform, Python and GitLab/GitHub Actions for CI/CD.

#### **September 2019 - October 2020:** Graduate Solution Architect - *Red Hat*

During my time at Red Hat I helped to deliver a range of workshops for customers and partners on subjects including Ansible automation, OpenShift and Kubernetes, and agile methodologies. Throughout the graduate programme there was a strong emphasis on training and development. In terms of technical training, I gained skills in Linux system administration, Ansible automation, and OpenShift/Kubernetes, achieving RHCSA and RHCE (Red Hat Certified System Administrator/Engineer) qualifications. Soft skills development included instructor-led courses in sales technique and delivering presentations. Beyond the formal training provided by Red Hat, I explored other areas of interest, including AI/Machine Learning on Kubernetes, and gained experience contributing to open source projects.

#### **July 2017 - July 2019:** Technical Theatre & AV Specialist - *Collingwood College, Durham University*

I oversaw the technical theatre and AV facilities in a £7m+ development, which includes a bar, a common room, a fitness suite, and a 150-seat arts venue. This involved liaising with key stakeholders over the course of the whole project, including technical design, writing detailed technical specifications and documentation, and presentations to the alumnus donor which led to over £250k of additional funding. Upon completion of the project, I oversaw the day-to-day running of the venue, working closely with arts groups using the space, liaising with contractors regarding snagging issues, and training students.

Alongside the project, I performed a number of additional technical duties, including Portable Appliance Testing, equipment maintenance, developing IT systems, and advising on construction projects elsewhere in the university.

#### **Summer 2016:** Intern (Web Services) - *Computing & Information Services, Durham University*

I developed a web application designed to allow reception staff to quickly and easily notify residents of the college of a delivery in their name. This was a project that I had been working on in my spare time for my college within the university, that came to the attention of the IT team by means of a change request that I submitted prior to being offered this position.

## Voluntary Experience

#### **February 2015 - May 2016:** Communications Officer - *Collingwood College JCR*

I was responsible for co-ordinating communication between officers and members of the JCR (student body), including launch and maintenance of the JCR website, maintenance and regular update of the digital signage in the college, and maintenance of JCR mailing lists. I sat on the Executive Committee of the JCR that manages the day-to-day operations of the student body.

#### **June 2014 - June 2015:** Technical Manager - *Durham Student Theatre*

I oversaw the technical services within Durham Student Theatre, including regular training for student technicians, maintenance of equipment, and facilities within the Assembly Rooms Theatre, Durham. I sat on the Executive Committee that managed the society in its day-to-day operations, including investment of funds into the development of the society.

#### **June 2014 - June 2015:** Technical Manager - *Collingwood College JCR*

I chaired the Technical Crew, responsible for providing technical services for student events. I oversaw investment of approx £10,000 into technical equipment, as well as regularly managing large budgets for technical services at events ranging from plays and musicals to large live music events.

## Other Interests and Activities

#### Technical Theatre & Events

I have been involved backstage for over 30 student theatre productions, as well as many college events. This has given me experience in many technical matters, including lighting design/programming, sound design and operation, pyrotechnics, and Production Management.

Additionally, I have been heavily involved in the specification of a number of technical installations. This has included theatre lighting and AV systems in the Collingwood dining hall, and a complete refit of the college recording studio. For both of these projects, I made a funding proposal to the college, designed and specified the equipment, and helped to install it.
