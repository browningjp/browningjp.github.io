## Work Experience

#### **July 2017 - Present:** Technical Theatre & AV Specialist - *Collingwood College, Durham University*

I am overseeing the technical and AV facilities in ongoing £6m+ development at Collingwood College, which includes a new common room, refurbished bar, gymnasium, fitness studio, and a 200-seat theatre.

This has involved liaising with key stakeholders over the course of the whole project, including technical design, writing detailed technical specifications and documentation, presentations to the alumnus donor (raising an additional >£250k as a result), and even contributing to electrical work on site.

Besides the Collingwood refurbishment project I perform a number of other technical roles, including Portable Appliance Testing (PAT), equipment maintenance and repair, creating and maintaining college IT systems, and consulting on theatre projects elsewhere in the university.

#### **Summer 2016:** Intern (Web Services) - *Computing & Information Services, Durham University*

Developed a web application designed to allow reception staff to quickly and easily notify residents of the college of a delivery in their name. This was a project that I had been working on in my spare time for my college within the university, that came to the attention of the IT team by means of a change request that I submitted prior to being offered this position. The main technologies used in this project were PHP, Laravel, Javascript, jQuery, HTML5 and CSS3.
